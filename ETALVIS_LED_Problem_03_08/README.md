# Problem 8: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Glow in Groups (3-4, 5-6-7, 0-1-2)

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and glow them in the sequence:  
- 3,4  
- 5,6,7  
- 0,1,2

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for the sequence  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project source info

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443681128780419073)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to observe the sequence.

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs glow in order: (3,4) → (5,6,7) → (0,1,2), with a delay after each step.
