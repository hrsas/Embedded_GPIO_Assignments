# Problem 4: Display "WELCOME" Entering WELC from Bottom and Leaving by Left (Revolving Continuously)

**Objective:**  
Display **WELCOME** with animation such that **WELC** enters from **bottom**, and the word **leaves to the left**, continuously revolving.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Bottom-entry left-exit loop animation  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Circuit for MAX7219 Dot Matrix  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation project info  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446220948065289217)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Load simulation on Wokwi.  
2. Run sketch.  
3. Observe animation cycle.

**Expected Output:**  
- Characters “WELC” rise upward into the matrix.  
- “WELCOME” scrolls left and loops endlessly.
