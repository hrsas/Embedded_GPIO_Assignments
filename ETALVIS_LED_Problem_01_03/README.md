# Problem 3: LEDs on Port H Bits 0 & 1

**Objective:**  
Connect two LEDs to Port H, Bit 0 and Bit 1, and glow only the two least significant bit (LSB) LEDs. 

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443589040893715457)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LEDs connected to Port H, Bits 0 & 1 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the two LSB LEDs (Bit 0 and Bit 1) should glow.  
- All other LEDs connected to Port H should remain off.
