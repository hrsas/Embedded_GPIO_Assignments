# Problem 2: Display Left-Most Top LED on MAX7219 Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Light up the **left-most LED in the top row** on the 8x8 Dot Matrix driven by MAX7219 (Port A).

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code to turn ON left-most top LED  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit configuration  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation details  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445862322950492161)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload `sketch.ino` to Wokwi.  
2. Verify dot matrix connections.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the **top row, left-most LED** glows.  
- All other LEDs remain OFF.
