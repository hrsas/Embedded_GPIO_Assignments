# Problem 1: LEDs on Port A & B Bits 0–7 Glow on Both Rows

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A and Port B, Bits 0 to 7, and turn **ON all LEDs** in both the first and second row simultaneously.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to glow LEDs on both rows  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443685446986895361)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see all LEDs glow on both rows.

**Expected Output:**  
- All LEDs in Port A (row 1) and Port B (row 2) glow simultaneously.
