# Problem 1: Display Characters A to E in One-Second Intervals on 8x8 LED Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Display the uppercase characters **A, B, C, D, and E** sequentially on an **8x8 LED Dot Matrix**, with each character displayed for **1 second** before moving to the next.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to display characters A–E  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Circuit diagram for 8x8 dot matrix setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi project source details  

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445219660770972673)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open the project on Wokwi.  
2. Upload `sketch.ino` and verify connections as per `diagram.json`.  
3. Run the simulation to see each character appear for 1 second in sequence.

**Expected Output:**  
- Character **A** appears first, stays for 1 second.  
- Then **B**, **C**, **D**, and **E** follow in the same manner.  
- The sequence loops continuously.
