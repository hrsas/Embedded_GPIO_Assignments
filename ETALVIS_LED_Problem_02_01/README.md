# Problem 1: LED on Port J Bit 0 (LSB) Blink Every Second

**Objective:**  
Connect an LED to Port J, Bit 0 (LSB), and make it blink at a 1-second interval.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to blink the LED  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443594336473967617)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LED at PJ0 blink every second.

**Expected Output:**  
- LED connected to Port J, Bit 0 should toggle ON and OFF every 1 second.
