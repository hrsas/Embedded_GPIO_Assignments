# Problem 2: Display Characters a to e in One-Second Intervals on 8x8 LED Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Display the lowercase characters **a, b, c, d, and e** sequentially on the **8x8 LED Dot Matrix**, with each character visible for **1 second** before transitioning.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to display lowercase letters  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix wiring configuration  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi simulation metadata
