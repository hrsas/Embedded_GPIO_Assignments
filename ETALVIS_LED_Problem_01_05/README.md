# Problem 5: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–3

**Objective:**  
Connect four LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 3, and glow only the four least significant bit (LSB) LEDs.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443591233404958721)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LEDs connected to Port A, Bits 0–3 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the four LSB LEDs (Bits 0–3) should glow.  
- All other LEDs connected to Port A should remain off.
