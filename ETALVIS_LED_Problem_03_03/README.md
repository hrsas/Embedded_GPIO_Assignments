# Problem 3: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Glow Forward and Backward

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and glow LEDs sequentially:  
- From 0 to 7 (increasing order)  
- Then from 7 back to 0 (decreasing order)  

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino`  
- `wokwi/diagram.json`  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt`

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs turn ON one by one from Bit 0 → Bit 7.  
- Then reverse: Bit 7 → Bit 0.  
- Cycle repeats with delay.
