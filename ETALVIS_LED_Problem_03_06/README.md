# Problem 6: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Glow in Pairs (4-5, 2-3, 6-7, 0-1)

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and glow LEDs in this sequence of pairs:  
- (4,5)  
- (2,3)  
- (6,7)  
- (0,1)

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for LED sequence  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project source info

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443680960132660225)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to observe the pair sequence with delay.

**Expected Output:**  
- Pairs glow sequentially in the order: (4,5) → (2,3) → (6,7) → (0,1).  
- A delay occurs between each pair.
