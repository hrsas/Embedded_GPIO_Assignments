# Problem 2: LED on Port D Bit 7

**Objective:**  
 Connect a LED to port D bit 7. Glow MSB LED only (bit 7)

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LED  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443587835178830849)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if required.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LED connected to Port D, Bit 7 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the MSB LED (Bit 7) should glow.  
- All other LEDs connected to Port D should remain off.
