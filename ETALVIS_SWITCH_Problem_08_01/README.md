# Problem 1: Press 0th Switch to Glow All 8 LEDs

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A (Bits 0–7) and eight push-button switches to Port B (Bits 0–7).  
When the **0th switch** (Bit 0 of Port B) is pressed, **all 8 LEDs** on Port A should glow.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code to glow all LEDs when Switch 0 is pressed  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project information/source

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Connect 8 LEDs to Port A (Bits 0–7).  
2. Connect 8 switches to Port B (Bits 0–7).  
3. Press **Switch 0** — all LEDs should glow simultaneously.  

**Expected Output:**  
Pressing **Switch 0** → All 8 LEDs on Port A turn ON.
