# Problem 4: Common Anode Display 0–9 with Decimal Point and 1 Second Delay

**Objective:**  
Connect a **common anode 7-segment display** to Port A and display digits **0 through 9** sequentially with the **decimal point ON**, and a **1-second delay** between each digit.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for displaying 0–9 with DP  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443765898460944385)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see digits 0–9 appear with decimal point and 1-second delay.

**Expected Output:**  
- Display shows 0 → 1 → … → 9 sequentially.  
- Decimal point is always ON.  
- Each digit is displayed for **1 second**.
