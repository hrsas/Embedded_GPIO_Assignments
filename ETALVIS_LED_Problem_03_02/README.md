# Problem 2: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Glow in Pairs (0-4, 1-5, 2-6, 3-7)

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and glow the LEDs in the following sequence with delay:  
- 0 and 4  
- 1 and 5  
- 2 and 6  
- 3 and 7  

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino`  
- `wokwi/diagram.json`  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt`

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs glow pairwise in the order: (0,4) → (1,5) → (2,6) → (3,7).  
- Delay between each pair.
