# Problem 3: Display Right-Most Bottom LED on MAX7219 Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Illuminate the **right-most LED of the bottom row** on the MAX7219-controlled 8x8 LED Matrix.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for bottom-right LED  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Matrix connection details  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi project info  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445862370837913601)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load circuit diagram if required.  
3. Run the simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the **bottom row, right-most LED** glows.  
- Remaining LEDs stay OFF.
