# Problem 10: Display "1234" with 12 Entering from Right and 34 Entering from Left in 4s

**Objective:**  
Animate digits **1234** with a cross-entry:  
- Digits **12** come from the **right**,  
- Digits **34** come from the **left**,  
- Meet at center within **4 seconds**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Cross-entry logic code  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix wiring  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation configuration  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445986029544945665)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload sketch in Wokwi.  
2. Run simulation.  
3. Observe left-right simultaneous entry.

**Expected Output:**  
- Digits **12** slide in from right, **34** slide in from left.  
- Merge into “1234” at center.
