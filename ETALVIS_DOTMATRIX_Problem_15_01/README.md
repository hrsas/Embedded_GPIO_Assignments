# Problem 1: Display "1" on MAX7219 Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Using the MAX7219-driven 8x8 Dot Matrix connected to **Port A**, display the digit **1** on the LED matrix.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code to display number 1  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → MAX7219 circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation details  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445863758216322049)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Upload and connect as per diagram.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- The **digit “1”** appears on the LED dot matrix.  
- Only one digit is displayed.
