# Problem 3: Display Numbers 0 to 4 in One-Second Intervals on 8x8 LED Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Display **digits 0 to 4** sequentially on an 8x8 LED Dot Matrix, each lasting for **1 second**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main logic for digit display  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix circuit setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project information  

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445227018670512129)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open and upload `sketch.ino` to Wokwi.  
2. Verify LED connections to matrix pins.  
3. Run simulation to view number sequence.

**Expected Output:**  
- Displays **0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4** with 1-second intervals.  
- Loops after reaching 4.
