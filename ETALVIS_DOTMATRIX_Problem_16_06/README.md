# Problem 6: Display "1234" with 12 Entering from Left and 34 Entering from Right in 4s

**Objective:**  
Display digits **1234** with a **dual-entry animation**:  
- **12** comes from the **left**,  
- **34** comes from the **right**,  
- Both meet in the center within **4 seconds**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Dual-entry animation code  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix circuit  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation file  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445970320937018369)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open Wokwi project.  
2. Run simulation.  
3. Observe dual-side entry.

**Expected Output:**  
- Digits **12** enter from left, **34** enter from right.  
- They align together as “1234”.
