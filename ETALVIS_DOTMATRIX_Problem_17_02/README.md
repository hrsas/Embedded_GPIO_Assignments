# Problem 2: Display "WELCOME" by Entering from Right and Leaving by Left (Revolving Continuously)

**Objective:**  
Display **WELCOME** so that it **enters from the right**, scrolls through, **exits left**, and **revolves continuously**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Right-to-left revolving text code  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix wiring setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi simulation data  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446176818183409665)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Load project on Wokwi.  
2. Upload `sketch.ino`.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- “WELCOME” scrolls **from right to left**, exits, and reappears again continuously.  
- Smooth revolving motion across the matrix.
