# Problem 2: LEDs on Port A & B Blink Rows Alternately

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A and Port B, Bits 0 to 7, and **blink first and second row alternately** every second.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` â†’ Main code for alternate row blinking  
- `wokwi/diagram.json`  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt`  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443686463766311937)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to observe alternate blinking.

**Expected Output:**  
- Row 1 LEDs glow while row 2 is OFF.  
- After 1 second, row 2 LEDs glow while row 1 is OFF.  
- Repeat continuously.
