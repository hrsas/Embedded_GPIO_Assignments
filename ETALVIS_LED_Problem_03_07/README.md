# Problem 7: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Glow in Groups (0-1-2, 5-6-7, 3-4)

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and glow them in groups with delay:  
- 0,1,2  
- 5,6,7  
- 3,4

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for grouped LED sequence  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project source info

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443681033258268673)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to observe group-wise LED activation.

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs glow in the order: (0,1,2) → (5,6,7) → (3,4) with a delay after each group.
