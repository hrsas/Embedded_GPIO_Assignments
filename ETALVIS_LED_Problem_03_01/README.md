# Problem 1: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Glow in Pairs (3-7, 2-6, 1-5, 0-4)

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and glow the LEDs in the following pair sequence with delay:  
- 3 and 7  
- 2 and 6  
- 1 and 5  
- 0 and 4  

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for LED sequence  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project source info  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443679063520249857)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to observe the sequence.  

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs glow in the sequence: (3,7) → (2,6) → (1,5) → (0,4).  
- A delay occurs between each pair.
