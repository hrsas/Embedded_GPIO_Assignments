# Problem 9: Display Diagonal LEDs from Left-Top to Right-Bottom

**Objective:**  
Display a diagonal line of LEDs starting from the **top-left corner** to the **bottom-right corner** on the 8x8 LED Dot Matrix.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for left-top to right-bottom diagonal  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → MAX7219 wiring diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation data  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445862654392817665)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload sketch in Wokwi.  
2. Run simulation.  
3. Observe diagonal LEDs glowing.

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs at positions `(0,0), (1,1), (2,2)...(7,7)` are ON.  
- They form a perfect diagonal line from **top-left → bottom-right**.
