# Problem 4: Display "ETAL" Entering from Left in 2s, Stay 10s, Exit Bottom in 4s

**Objective:**  
Animate **ETAL** so that it:  
- Enters from **left** in **2 seconds**,  
- Stays for **10 seconds**,  
- Exits by moving to the **bottom** in **4 seconds**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Left-entry, bottom-exit code  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix wiring  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation details  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445968774439128065)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open simulation in Wokwi.  
2. Upload code.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- “ETAL” slides in from **left** in 2s.  
- Holds for 10s.  
- Drops out via **bottom** in 4s.
