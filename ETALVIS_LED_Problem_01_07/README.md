# Problem 7: LEDs on Port F Bits 0–7

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port F, Bits 0 to 7, and glow all eight LEDs. 

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443589731454633985)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see all LEDs connected to Port F glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- All 8 LEDs (Bits 0–7) should glow simultaneously.
