# Problem 10: LEDs on Port E Bits 0–7 (Bits 5, 4, 3, 1)

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port E, Bits 0 to 7, and glow only the LEDs at Bits 5, 4, 3, and 1.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443592643590324225)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see only the LEDs at Bits 5, 4, 3, and 1 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs at Bits 5, 4, 3, and 1 should glow.  
- All other LEDs (Bits 0, 2, 6, 7) should remain off.
