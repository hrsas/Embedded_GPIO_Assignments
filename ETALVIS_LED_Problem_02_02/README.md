# Problem 2: LEDs on Port A Bits 0–7 Blink Every Second

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A, Bits 0 to 7, and make all eight LEDs blink simultaneously at a 1-second interval.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to blink all 8 LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443595977515944961)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see all 8 LEDs blink every 1 second.

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs at Port A, Bits 0 through 7 should toggle ON and OFF together every 1 second.
