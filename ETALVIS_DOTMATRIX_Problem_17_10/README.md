# Problem 10: Glow Diagonal LEDs One by One on 32x32 Display

**Objective:**  
Sequentially light up **diagonal LEDs one by one** on a **32x32 LED matrix**, forming a moving diagonal animation.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for diagonal LED animation  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → 32x32 LED matrix wiring diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project info  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446326449079134209)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Load sketch in Wokwi.  
2. Start simulation.  
3. Observe diagonal lighting pattern.

**Expected Output:**  
- LEDs glow **diagonally from top-left to bottom-right** one by one.  
- Pattern repeats continuously across 32x32 display.
