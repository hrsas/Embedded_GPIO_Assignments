# Problem 7: Common Anode Display Even Numbers 0–8 with 1 Second Delay

**Objective:**  
Connect a **common anode 7-segment display** to Port A and display **even numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8** sequentially with **1-second delay**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for displaying even numbers  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443766222774053889)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see digits 0 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 8 appear sequentially.

**Expected Output:**  
- Display shows **0, 2, 4, 6, 8** sequentially.  
- Each digit is displayed for **1 second**.
