# Problem 4: Press 7th Switch to Sequentially Glow 0th, 1st, 4th, and 7th LEDs

**Objective:**  
On pressing the **7th switch** (PB6), LEDs **0, 1, 4, and 7** connected to Port A glow one by one with delays.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino`  
- `wokwi/diagram.json`  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt`

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/444041846349848577)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Simulate the circuit in Wokwi.  
2. Press the 7th switch.  
3. LEDs light in sequence 0 → 1 → 4 → 7.

**Expected Output:**  
- 0th LED ON → delay → OFF  
- 1st LED ON → delay → OFF  
- 4th LED ON → delay → OFF  
- 7th LED ON → delay → OFF
