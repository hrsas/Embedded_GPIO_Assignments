# Problem 2: Display "ETAL" Entering from Top in 4s, Stay 10s, Exit Right in 4s

**Objective:**  
Animate **ETAL** such that it:  
- Enters from **top** in **4 seconds**,  
- Stays for **10 seconds**,  
- Exits toward the **right** in **4 seconds**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for top-entry, stay, right-exit  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Circuit wiring  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation reference  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445955185415817217)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open project in Wokwi.  
2. Upload `sketch.ino`.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- “ETAL” slides down from **top** in 4s.  
- Remains for 10s.  
- Moves out to the **right** in 4s.
