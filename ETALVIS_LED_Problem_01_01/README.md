# Problem 1: LED on Port J Bit 0

**Objective:**  
Connect an LED to Port J, Bit 0, and glow only the least significant bit (LSB) LED. This exercise demonstrates basic GPIO output control.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LED  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443543327131820033)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if required.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LED connected to Port J, Bit 0 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the LSB LED (Bit 0) should glow.  
- All other LEDs connected to Port J should remain off.
