# Problem 1: Display Right-Most Top LED on MAX7219 Dot Matrix

**Objective:**  
Using the MAX7219-controlled 8x8 Dot Matrix connected to **Port A**, display the **right-most LED in the top row**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code to turn ON right-most top LED  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for MAX7219 setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445356860775383041)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Ensure wiring of MAX7219 and dot matrix is correct as per `diagram.json`.  
3. Run simulation to light up the **right-most top LED**.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the **top row, right-most LED** glows.  
- All other LEDs remain OFF.
