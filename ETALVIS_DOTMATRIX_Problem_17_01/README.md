# Problem 1: Display "WELCOME" by Entering from Left and Leaving by Right (Revolving Continuously)

**Objective:**  
Animate the text **WELCOME** on the MAX7219 Dot Matrix connected to Port A such that it **enters from the left**, **moves through**, and **exits from the right** continuously in a revolving loop.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for continuous left-to-right revolving text  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → MAX7219 circuit setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation metadata  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446082388968994817)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Verify wiring with `diagram.json`.  
3. Run the simulation to observe revolving text.

**Expected Output:**  
- “WELCOME” scrolls **from left to right**, exits, and re-enters again seamlessly.  
- The motion is **continuous and looping**.
