# Problem 3: Display Numbers 0.0 to 9.9 on 7-Segment Display with 0.5s Delay

**Objective:**  
Connect a 7-segment display to **Port A** and **Port B**, and display numbers from **0.0 to 9.9** with a **0.5-second delay**, incrementing by **0.1**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for 0.0–9.9 counter  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit with Port A and B setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project reference  

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443883192146945025)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open the provided Wokwi files.  
2. Run the simulation and observe decimal counting.  

**Expected Output:**  
- The display shows **0.0 → 0.1 → 0.2 → ... → 9.9**  
- Decimal point remains lit between digits.
