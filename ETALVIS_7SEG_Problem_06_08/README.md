# Problem 8: Common Anode Display Odd Numbers 1–9 and Even Numbers 8–0 with 1 Second Delay

**Objective:**  
Connect a **common anode 7-segment display** to Port A and display **odd numbers 1–9** first, then **even numbers 8–0** sequentially with **1-second delay**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code for odd and even numbers  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443766364617053185)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see digits 1 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 2 → 0 appear sequentially.

**Expected Output:**  
- Display shows **1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0** sequentially.  
- Each digit is displayed for **1 second**.
