# Problem 6: LEDs on Port B Bits 4–7

**Objective:**  
Connect four LEDs to Port B, Bits 4 to 7, and glow only the four most significant bit (MSB) LEDs.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443589596637051905)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LEDs connected to Port B, Bits 4–7 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the four MSB LEDs (Bits 7–4) should glow.  
- All other LEDs connected to Port B should remain off.
