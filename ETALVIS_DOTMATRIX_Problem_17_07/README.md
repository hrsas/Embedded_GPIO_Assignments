# Problem 7: Display "ETAL" on Top Entering from Top and "1234" on Bottom Entering from Bottom Simultaneously

**Objective:**  
Display both **ETAL** and **1234** where:  
- **ETAL** enters from the **top half downward**,  
- **1234** enters from the **bottom half upward**,  
and both appear **simultaneously**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for simultaneous top-bottom entry  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → MAX7219 wiring schematic  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi simulation info  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446316922777232385)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Load sketch into Wokwi.  
2. Run simulation.  
3. Watch both halves animate together.

**Expected Output:**  
- “ETAL” appears sliding down from top.  
- “1234” appears sliding up from bottom.  
- Both stabilize in position.
