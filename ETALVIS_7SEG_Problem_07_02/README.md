# Problem 2: Display Numbers 00 to 90 on 7-Segment Display with 1s Delay

**Objective:**  
Connect a 7-segment display to **Port A** and **Port B**, and display numbers from **00 to 90** with a **1-second delay** between each increment.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for counting 00–90  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit for Port A and B  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original project info  

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443881073541885953)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload and run the code in Wokwi.  
2. Observe the display counting from **00, 10, 20, ... to 90** with **1 second delay**.

**Expected Output:**  
- The display increments tens place by 10 each second until it reaches 90.
