# Problem 6: Display "ETAL" for 10 Seconds, Then Erase from Right for 3 Seconds

**Objective:**  
Show the text **ETAL** on the matrix for **10 seconds**, then erase it **from right to left** over **3 seconds**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for timed display and erase  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dot matrix circuit setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi metadata  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445864986426147841)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload sketch into Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation.  
3. Observe the timing-based display.

**Expected Output:**  
- Displays **ETAL** for 10 seconds.  
- Letters start disappearing **one by one from the right** over 3 seconds.  
- Screen becomes blank.
