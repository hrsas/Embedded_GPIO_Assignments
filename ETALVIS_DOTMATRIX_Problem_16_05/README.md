# Problem 5: Display "ETAL" Entering from Top in 4s, Stay 10s, Exit by Splitting Left & Right

**Objective:**  
Show the word **ETAL** with this sequence:  
- Enter from **top** in **4 seconds**,  
- Stay 10 seconds,  
- Exit by **splitting outward** with half text leaving to the **left** and half to the **right**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Top-entry with split-exit logic  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Circuit wiring  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project details

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload code in Wokwi.  
2. Run simulation.  
3. Observe split-exit behavior.

**Expected Output:**  
- “ETAL” drops down from **top** in 4s.  
- Stays 10s.  
- Splits outward: left part moves left, right part moves right.
