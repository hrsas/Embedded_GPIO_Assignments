# Problem 5: Display Revolving Text "WELCOME" Right to Left

**Objective:**  
Animate the word **WELCOME** scrolling **from right to left** across the 8x8 LED Dot Matrix.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Scrolling text code (right to left)  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Circuit wiring for dot matrix  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi metadata  

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/445227702637834241)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` on Wokwi.  
2. Run simulation to see “WELCOME” scroll right to left.  
3. Adjust delay values for scrolling speed.

**Expected Output:**  
- Text “WELCOME” moves smoothly **from right to left** across the matrix.  
- Repeats continuously after the last character exits.
