# Problem 4: Dot Matrix Glow Left-Most Bottom LED

**Objective:**  
Connect an 8×8 LED dot matrix and glow **only the bottom-most LED in the left-most column**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control dot matrix  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/444971490851951617)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see the bottom-left LED glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the **bottom-left LED** is ON.  
- All other LEDs remain OFF.
