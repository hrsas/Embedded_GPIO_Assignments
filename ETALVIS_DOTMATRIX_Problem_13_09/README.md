# Problem 9: Display "WELCOME" with Odd Positions Entering from Left and Even Positions from Right

**Objective:**  
Display the text **WELCOME** on 8x8 Dot Matrix where:  
- Odd-positioned letters enter from **left**, and  
- Even-positioned letters enter from **right** simultaneously.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Bidirectional text animation logic  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dual-direction display circuit  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi project details  

**Simulation Link:**

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Load the code on Wokwi.  
2. Observe odd letters moving in from left, even letters from right.  
3. Adjust timing for synchronization.

**Expected Output:**  
- Letters in **odd positions** (W, L, O, E) slide in from **left**.  
- Letters in **even positions** (E, C, M) slide in from **right**.  
- Together, they form the word “WELCOME” at center alignment.
