# Problem 3: Display "ETAL" Entering from Right in 2s, Stay 10s, Exit Top in 4s

**Objective:**  
Show **ETAL** with the following sequence:  
- Enter from the **right** in **2 seconds**,  
- Stay for **10 seconds**,  
- Exit through the **top** in **4 seconds**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Right-entry, top-exit animation code  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → MAX7219 schematic  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation data
