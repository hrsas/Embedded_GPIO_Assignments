# Problem 4: Display 25 Using Two 7-Segment Displays with Common Pins on Port B

**Objective:**  
Connect **two 7-segment displays** to **Port A** with their **common pins** connected to **Bit 0 and Bit 1** of **Port B**, and display the number **25**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for displaying number 25  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Dual 7-segment display wiring  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi project data

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Load the code and ensure both displays share Port A for segments.  
2. Common pins connected to Port B bits 0 and 1.  
3. Run simulation.  

**Expected Output:**  
- First display shows **2**, second display shows **5**.
