# Problem 5: Display 00 to 90 Using Two 7-Segment Displays with 1s Delay

**Objective:**  
Connect **two 7-segment displays** to **Port A**, with **common pins** connected to **Bit 0** and **Bit 1** of **Port B**, and display numbers **00 to 90** with a **1-second delay**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Counter code for 00–90  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Circuit diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Project reference file  

**Simulation Link:**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443885718153195521)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload code to Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to observe both digits counting together.  

**Expected Output:**  
- Numbers increase by tens each second: 00 → 10 → 20 → ... → 90.
