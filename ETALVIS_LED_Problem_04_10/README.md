# Problem 10: LEDs on Port A & B Blink Pairs from Bit 7 to Bit 0

**Objective:**  
Connect eight LEDs to Port A and Port B, Bits 0 to 7, and **blink LEDs in pairs from bit 7 to bit 0 on both rows**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino`  
- `wokwi/diagram.json`  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt`  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443688615183840257)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation to see pairwise blinking from right → left.

**Expected Output:**  
- LED pairs: (7,7), (6,6), … (0,0) blink sequentially.  
- Only **two LEDs are ON** at a time (one per row).
