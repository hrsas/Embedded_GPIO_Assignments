# Problem 9: Display "SB" in 16x16 Pixel Resolution, Wipe from Left after 10 Seconds

**Objective:**  
Show **SB** in 16x16 resolution, keep displayed for **10 seconds**, then **wipe the display from left to right**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for timed wipe animation  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → 16x16 LED matrix circuit  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation details

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Run Wokwi simulation.  
2. Observe “SB” for 10 seconds.  
3. Watch the left-to-right wipe effect.

**Expected Output:**  
- “SB” remains visible for 10s.  
- Display clears progressively **from left to right** afterward.
