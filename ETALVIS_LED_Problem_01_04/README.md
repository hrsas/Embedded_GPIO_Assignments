# Problem 4: LEDs on Port C Bits 6 & 7

**Objective:**  
Connect two LEDs to Port C, Bit 6 and Bit 7, and glow only the two most significant bit (MSB) LEDs. This exercise demonstrates controlling specific GPIO outputs at the higher end of a port.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Main code to control the LEDs  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit diagram for the setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Original Wokwi project information/source

**Simulation Link (Optional):**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/443589177144660993)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if needed.  
3. Run the simulation to see the LEDs connected to Port C, Bits 6 & 7 glow.

**Expected Output:**  
- Only the two MSB LEDs (Bit 7 and Bit 6) should glow.  
- All other LEDs connected to Port C should remain off.
